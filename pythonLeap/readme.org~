* Description
  This repository includes code that allows a [[https://www.leapmotion.com/][Leapmotion]] to control a
  sound granulator.  A python script is used to get the data from the
  leap.  The sensor's data is then sent as OSC messages to
  SuperCollider where they are mapped to the parameters of a
  granulator.
